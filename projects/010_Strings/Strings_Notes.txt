CHARACTER SEQUENCES

Because strings are sequences of characters, we can represent them also as plain arrays of elements of a character
type. For example: char foo [20]; This array has a capacity to store sequences of up to 20 characters. But this
capacity does not need to be fully exhausted, the array can also accommodate shorter sequences.

By convention, the end of strings represented in character sequences is signaled by the null character, whose
literal value can be written as '\0'.


Initialization of null-terminated character sequences

To initialize an array with a predetermined sequence of characters:    

char myword[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };

This declares an array of 6 elements of type char initialized with characters that form the word "Hello" plus a
null character '\0' (or 0) at the end.

Arrays of character elements may also be initialized using string literals directly. Sequences of characters enclosed
in double-quotes ("") are literal constants. And their type is a null-terminated array of characters. This means that
string literals always have a null character ('\0') automatically appended at the end:

char myword[] = "Hello";

Note that we are talking about initializing an array of characters at the moment it is being declared, and NOT about
assigning values to them later (once they have already been declared). In fact, because string literals are regular
arrays, they have the same restrictions as these, and cannot be assigned values. Once myword is declared (as above),
expressions such as:

myword = "Bye";
myword[] = "Bye";
myword = { 'B', 'y', 'e', '\0' };

are NOT valid!!!!

However, each of the array elements can be assigned a value individually:

myword[0] = 'B';
myword[1] = 'y';
myword[2] = 'e';
myword[3] = '\0';


Strings and null-terminated character sequences

Plain arrays with null-terminated sequences of characters are the types used in c-language to represent strings
(they are also known as c-strings). In c++, even though the standard library defines a specific type for strings
(class string), (c-strings) are still a natural way of representing strings in the language; in fact, string literals
still always produce null-terminated character sequences, and not string objects.

In the standard library, both representations for strings (c-strings and library strings) coexist, and most functions
requiring strings are overloaded to support both.

For example, cin and cout support null-terminated sequences directly, allowing them to be directly extracted from cin
or inserted into cout, just like strings.

Character sequence arrays have a fixed size that needs to be specified either implicitly or explicitly when declared,
while strings are simply strings, no size is specified. This is due to the fact that strings have a dynamic size
determined during runtime, while the size of arrays is determined on compilation, before the program runs.

Null-terminated character sequences can be transformed into strings implicitly, and strings can be transformed into
null-terminated character sequences by using either of string's member functions c_str or data:

char myntcs[] = "some text";
string mystring = myntcs;  // convert c-string to string
cout << mystring;          // printed as a library string
cout << mystring.c_str();  // printed as a c-string

(note: the c_str and data members of string are equivalent)
