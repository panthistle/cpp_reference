BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT

c++ uses an abstraction called streams to perform input and output operations in sequential media such as the screen,
the keyboard or a file. A stream is an entity where a program can either insert or extract characters to/from. There
is no need to know details about the media associated to the stream or any of its internal specifications. All we need
to know is that streams are a source/destination of characters, and that these characters are provided/accepted
sequentially (i.e., one after another).

The standard library defines a handful of stream objects that can be used to access what are considered the standard
sources and destinations of characters by the environment where the program runs:

stream	    description
cin	      standard input stream
cout	    standard output stream
cerr	    standard error (output) stream
clog	    standard logging (output) stream

In most program environments, the standard output by default is the screen, and the c++ stream object defined to
access it is cout. The << operator inserts the data that follows it into the stream that precedes it. In the case of
cout the data is printed to the screen. Similarly, in most program environments, the standard input by default is the
keyboard, and the c++ stream object defined to access it is cin. To get an entire line from cin, there exists a
function called getline, that takes the stream (cin) as first argument, and the string variable as second. The
standard header <sstream> defines a type called stringstream that allows a string to be treated as a stream, and thus
allowing extraction or insertion operations from/to strings in the same way as they are performed on cin and cout.
This is useful when converting between strings and numerical values.
