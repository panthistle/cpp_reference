C++ PROGRAM BASICS

-   Lines beginning with // are comments. To comment out a block of lines, use /*.... */
-   Pre-processor directives begin with a hash sign (#). They are interpreted before the compilation of the
    program itself begins. Each directive occupies one full line and does not end with a semi-column (;)
-   Include directives copy/paste the contents of the library/header to the current file (eg. #include <iostream>)
-   The "using namespace std;" declaration enables visibility of the standard c++ library allowing all elements in
    the std namespace to be accessed in an unqualified manner (without the std:: prefix)
-   c++ does not have strict rules on indentation or on how to split instructions in different lines. This is just
    a matter of programming style of the author to improve readability of the code.
-   In c++, the separation between statements is specified with an ending semicolon (;)
-   The cout (output stream object), the << (stream insertion operator), the cin (input stream object) and the >>
    (stream extraction operator) are all members of the std library. Operators are actually functions.
-   int main() is the entry function of a c++ program.
-   to keep the terminal window open use: std::cin.get() before the closing bracket
-   Two main build configurations exist: debug and release. The build output could be executable, static/dynamic
    library, etc.
-   The project/solution platform is the target system for the application
-   The compiler compiles all source files (.cpp , .c) separately, including all #include directives, and it creates
    intermediate translation units (binary object files). Then, the linker links those files, based on declarations
    of functions, etc., and it generates the final executable.
