Compound assignment

expression	    equivalent to...
y += x;             y = y + x;
x -= 5;             x = x - 5;
x /= y;             x = x / y;
a *= b + 1;	    a = a * (b+1);


Increment/decrement

expression      equivalent to       equivalent to
++x;            x+=1;               x=x+1;

Example prefix	                    Example suffix
x = 3;                              x = 3;
y = ++x;                            y = x++;
// x contains 4, y contains 4       // x contains 4, y contains 3


Relational and comparison operators

operator	  description
==          Equal to
!=	        Not equal to
<	          Less than
>	          Greater than
<=	        Less than or equal to
>=	        Greater than or equal to


Logical operators

! OPERATOR (not)
The operator ! is the c++ operator for the Boolean operation NOT. It has only one operand, to its right, and
inverts it, producing false if its operand is true, and true if its operand is false.

!(5 == 5)   // evaluates to false 
!(6 <= 4)   // evaluates to true 
!true       // evaluates to false
!false      // evaluates to true

&& OPERATOR (and)
a	    b	        a && b
true	true	    true
true	false	    false
false	true	    false
false	false	    false

|| OPERATOR (or)
a	    b	        a || b
true	true	    true
true	false	    true
false	true	    true
false	false	    false


Conditional ternary operator ( ? )

The conditional operator evaluates an expression, returning one value if that expression evaluates to true, and
another value if the expression evaluates as false. Its syntax is:

condition ? result1 : result2

7==5 ? 4 : 3     // evaluates to 3, since 7 is not equal to 5.
7==5+2 ? 4 : 3   // evaluates to 4
5>3 ? a : b      // evaluates to the value of a
a>b ? a : b      // evaluates to whichever is greater, a or b.


Comma operator ( , )

The comma operator (,) is used to separate two or more expressions that are included where only one expression is
expected. When the set of expressions has to be evaluated for a value, only the right-most expression is considered.

For example, the following code:

A = (B=3, B+2);

first assigns the value 3 to B, and then it assigns B+2 to A. So, A=5 and B=3.


Bitwise operators ( &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> )

Bitwise operators modify variables based on the bit patterns of their values.

operator	asm equivalent      description
&	        AND	            Bitwise AND
|	        OR	            Bitwise inclusive OR
^	        XOR	            Bitwise exclusive OR
~	        NOT	            Unary complement (bit inversion)
<<	      SHL	            Shift bits left
>>	      SHR	            Shift bits right


Explicit type casting operator

Type casting operators allow to convert a value of a given type to another type. There are several ways to do this
in c++. The simplest one, which is inherited from the c language, is to precede the expression to be converted by the
new type enclosed in parentheses:

int i;
float f = 3.14;
i = (int) f;

The previous code converts the floating-point number 3.14 to an integer value 3. The remainder is lost. Another way
to do the same thing in c++ is to use the functional notation preceding the expression to be converted by the type
and enclosing the expression in parentheses:

i = int (f);

Both ways of casting types are valid in c++.


sizeof

This operator accepts one parameter, which can be either a type or a variable, and returns the size in bytes of
that type or object:

size_t x = sizeof (char);

In the example above, x = 1, because char is a type with a size of one byte.

The value returned by sizeof is a compile-time constant, so it is always determined before program execution.
