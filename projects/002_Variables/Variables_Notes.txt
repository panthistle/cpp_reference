VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES

We define a variable as a portion of memory to store a value. 
Each variable has a name (identifier) which makes it unique.

Identifiers

A valid identifier is a sequence of one or more letters, digits, or underscore characters (_). Spaces, punctuation
marks, and symbols cannot be part of an identifier. In addition, identifiers shall always begin with a letter. They
can also begin with an underline character (_), but such identifiers are -in most cases- considered reserved for
compiler-specific keywords or external identifiers, as well as identifiers containing two successive underscore
characters anywhere. In no case can they begin with a digit.

c++ uses a number of keywords to identify operations and data descriptions; therefore, identifiers created by a
programmer cannot match these keywords. The standard reserved keywords are:

alignas, alignof, and, and_eq, asm, auto, bitand, bitor, bool, break, case, catch, char, char16_t, char32_t, class,
compl, const, constexpr, const_cast, continue, decltype, default, delete, do, double, dynamic_cast, else, enum,
explicit, export, extern, false, float, for, friend, goto, if, inline, int, long, mutable, namespace, new, noexcept,
not, not_eq, nullptr, operator, or, or_eq, private, protected, public, register, reinterpret_cast, return, short,
signed, sizeof, static, static_assert, static_cast, struct, switch, template, this, thread_local, throw, true, try,
typedef, typeid, typename, union, unsigned, using, virtual, void, volatile, wchar_t, while, xor, xor_eq

Specific compilers may also have additional specific reserved keywords.

The c++ language is a "case sensitive" language. That means that an identifier written in capital letters is not
equivalent to another one with the same name but written in small letters.


Fundamental types

Fundamental data types are basic types implemented directly by the language that represent the basic storage units
supported natively by most systems. They can mainly be classified into:

Group	                    Type names*	                   Notes on size / precision

Character types	            char	                   Exactly one byte in size. At least 8 bits.
                            char16_t	                   Not smaller than char. At least 16 bits.
                            char32_t	                   Not smaller than char16_t. At least 32 bits.
                            wchar_t	                   Can represent the largest supported character set.
Integer types (signed)	    signed char	                   Same size as char. At least 8 bits.
                            "signed" short "int"	   Not smaller than char. At least 16 bits.
                            "signed" int	           Not smaller than short. At least 16 bits.
                            "signed" long "int"	           Not smaller than int. At least 32 bits.
                            "signed" long long "int"	   Not smaller than long. At least 64 bits.
Integer types (unsigned)    unsigned char	           (same size as their signed counterparts)
                            unsigned short "int"
                            unsigned "int"
                            unsigned long "int"
                            unsigned long long "int"
Floating-point types	    float
                            double	                    Precision not less than float
                            long double	                    Precision not less than double
Boolean type	            bool
Void type	            void	                    no storage
Null pointer	            decltype(nullptr)

* The names of certain integer types can be abbreviated without their signed and int components - the part in double
  quotes is not required to identify the type. For example, signed short int can be abbreviated as signed short,
  short int, or simply short; they all identify the same fundamental type.

c++ is a strongly-typed language, and requires every variable to be declared with its type before first use.


Compound types

The c++ language has a rich set of compound types, of which the fundamental types are mere building blocks. An
example of compound type is the string class. Variables of this type are able to store sequences of characters, such
as words or sentences.

A first difference with fundamental data types is that in order to declare and use objects (variables) of this type,
the program needs to include the header where the type is defined within the standard library (for example,
#include <string>). Strings can be initialized with any valid string literal and, just like fundamental types, all
initialization formats are valid with strings.
